A bicycle is made of lots of different parts
    • bicycle frame and the handlebars will be manufactured inhouse
    • The other parts, such as the wheels, tires, brakes, and gears, can be outsourced for the initial production of the bicycles
    • The road bike uses dropped handlebars, while mountain bikes use a flat handlebar design. You shouldn’t interchange these parts.

Our bicycle design consists of four families of bicycles:
    • Road bicycles (the Hillcrest)
    • Mountain bicycles (The Palo Duro Canyon Ranger)
    • Recumbent bicycles (The Big Bend)
    • Cruiser bicycles (The Galveston Cruiser)

Each type has a particular type of frame, as well as a different design for handlebars. We can say we
will be making four families of bicycle components. 

When you encounter a problem that involves
families of related objects, you should automatically think about the abstract factory pattern
