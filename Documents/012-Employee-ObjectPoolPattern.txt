The object pool pattern creates an object that manages a collection of other objects.
The client requests objects from the pool to use them and then releases them when itâ€™s finished.

This uses the concurrent bag for the pool 


When the obj is in the pool then it will get returned. On release the item will get added to the pool. 

When no obj in the pool then the new obj will be created and returned.
